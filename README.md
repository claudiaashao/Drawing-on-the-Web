 Drawing on the Web [final project](https://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~zs1282/drawing/finalproject/)


For my final project, I want to provide a calm and relaxing interactive experience for the viewers. Therefore, I decided to make my overall theme LoFi. Lofi art often utilizes low resolution images like pixel art or glitch art, so I decided to create my own SVG graphics and added animations for each to create that low res GIF effect. I also added lofi music in the background for each drawing to further convey the appropriate feelings. 

From a design perspective, I paid a lot of attention to the overall cohesiveness and cleanliness. I made sure to use pastel color palettes and selected a similar illustration style for all drawings/images. I also didn't want to have an overly cramped composition, so I carefully planned out the position of each item. 


My finish projects include a navigation page and drawings of 3 different objects that perfectly represent the lofi theme I've chosen. 

- My navigation page consist of png pixel art that I made myself. I wanted to recreate a lofi version of the computer desktop. When viewers hover over each folder, they will get a sneak peak of each drawing, represented by the music I've carefully chosen for each.

- My first drawing is a recorder player that plays lofi music when the viewer hovers over the record. I tried to mimic the an actual record player by making the volume decrease gradually when the record player is "turned off". I also added a vinyl sound on top to add that lofi vintage feeling. In the background, viewers will see a big SVG sakura spinning and floating around, as well as a gif of falling sakura petals. 

- My second drawing is a view from the inside of a plane. Looking out the plane window, viewers can see clouds floating. When they hover over the window, it shows the outside view of clouds and rain. Depending on the time of day, the brightness changes. The entire experience is accompanied by lofi music which starts with a typical flight's take-off broadcast.

- My third drawing is the most interactive one. Viewers will see a cactus that starts off looking yellow and unhealthy. When they click on the water image, actual water will fall to help the cactus turn greener and healthier. The system will send alerts to inform viewers if they failed to water the cactus or overwatered it.


I hope after browsing through my drawings, you will feel calm and relaxed. Maybe you can even have it playing while you study :)
