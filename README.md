# Drawing-on-the-Web
 Drawing on the Web final project


For my final project, I want to provide a calm and relaxing interactive experience for the viewers. Drawing inspiration from the LoFi aesthetic, I want to create 3 objects with SVG graphics. The three I have in mind are a record player, a plane window, and a cactus. I want to have a relatively clean and simple background with a very detailed, well-animated object placed in the center, with some other animation happening when the user interact with the webpage. 
For the record player, it will spin when the user hovers on it, and music will be played whenever that happens. There will also be cherry blossoms falling whenever music is playing. 
For the plane window page, there will be clouds and random objects outside the window. The color of the whole page will change based on the time of the day. Something extra will appear when the user hovers over the window if time allows.
For the cactus, Iâ€™m planning to create a 3D cactus that change colors and shape based on whichever style the user chooses. There will also be an option to water the plant and monitor and water level as time passes, so it will be almost like a mini game. 
All three drawings will follow a pastel neon color palette and have similar illustration styles.
